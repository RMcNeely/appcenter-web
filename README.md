# AppCenter Web

Web frontend for viewing AppCenter apps

## Building

AppCenter Web is a simple Jekyll-powered site hosted by GitHub Pages. To run it locally, see [the GitHub docs](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/).

### Dependencies

This guide assumes you're on elementary OS or a similar Ubuntu-based environment.

#### Packages

- `ruby-full` (should include `ruby` and `ruby-dev`)
- `build-essential`
- `zlib1g-dev`

#### Ruby Stuff

- `jekyll` and `bundler`

We recommend installing gems to a (hidden) directory in your home folder:

```shell
echo '' >> ~/.bashrc
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/.gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/.gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo '' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Install jekyll and bundler:

```shell
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Install gems:

```shell
bundle install
```

(Adapted from https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

### Updating Apps

The list of apps is generated with a simple Ruby script. To rebuild the app list, run:

```shell
ruby bin/run.rb
```
It works in three parts, first it queries the server, downloads the latest tarball of releases and extracts them into yaml files based on the release. Then it parses the YAML files to generate corresponding MD entries for each app and finally rebuilds the HTML with Jekyll.

This is automatically run daily by Travis CI.

### Serve

```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

The site should now be available at http://0.0.0.0:4000/ on your local machine, and your local machine's IP address on your networkâ€”great for testing on mobile OSes.
