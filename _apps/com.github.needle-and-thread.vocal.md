            at a glance.</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Added a New Episode view to see all the unplayed episodes in

                your library at once.</li>

                episode that had already been downloaded.</li>

      <li>Performance and stability improvements with checking for new

                episodes.</li>

    <p>Grab some hot chocolate and curl up with a nice podcast this winter

            season, it&apos;s time for a new Vocal release! This time around, enjoy

            a ton of stability and performance enhancements, full HiDPI support, 

            and other bug fixes to make your experience as enjoyable as possible.</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Added HiDPI support for all images so everything looks nice and

    	        sharp no matter how fancy your display is.</li>

      <li>Fixed an issue where Vocal would not show you the time elapsed

    	        or remaining in an episode immediately after relaunching the app.</li>

      <li>Reduced the animation time for switching between different

    	        views so that it feels extra snappy.</li>

      <li>Gave the search results view a shave and a haircut. Two bits.</li>

      <li>Fixed a few issues where Vocal would be grouchy about

    	        showing certain episode descriptions.</li>

      <li>When importing several podcasts the progress bar now stays

    	        one size so you can actually judge the progress correctly.</li>

      <li>You can now drag and drop items in the play queue to rearrange

    	        their order.</li>

      <li>Lots more checking to make sure that things exist so it won&apos;t

    	        crash nearly as much (hopefully never).</li>

    </ul>
