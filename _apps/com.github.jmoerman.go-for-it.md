<p>Go For It! is a simple and stylish productivity app, featuring a to-do list, merged with a timer that keeps your focus on the current task.</p>
<p>To-do lists are stored in the Todo.txt format. This simplifies synchronization with mobile devices and makes it possible to edit tasks using other front-ends.</p>
<p>If you already use Todo.txt, beware of the fact, that Go For It! automatically archives completed tasks to the done list!</p>
