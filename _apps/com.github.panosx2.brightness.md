<p>Instead of adjusting the backlight, this app uses `xrandr` to change the brightness of the image displayed on your screen.  This can be useful for displays without an adjustable backlight, displays with a too-bright minimum, or too-dark maximum backlight, or OLED displays. Setups with multipe displays (maximum 4 displays) can also be adjusted with different brightness levels.</p>
